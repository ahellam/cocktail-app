User story:
- As a user I would like to:
    - Input a cocktail name into a form 
    - Have a description of the inputted cocktail show up on the page with…
        - Cocktail name
        - A picture
        - Recipe 

If all goes well with that.... 

Then.....
	- Have a “Look up a random cocktail” button that gets the same results to show on the page

	- Have a clickable “like button” that allows me to add likes to the cocktail
